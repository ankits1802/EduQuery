## 📖 Educational Methodology

EduQuery employs sophisticated educational methodologies to enhance learning outcomes.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The system uses RAG architecture to combine retrieval of relevant educational content with generative AI capabilities, ensuring responses are both accurate and contextually appropriate.

### Mathematical Formulations

**Relational Algebra Operations:**

* **Selection**: `σ_condition(R)`
* **Projection**: `π_attributes(R)`
* **Join**: `R ⨝ S`
* **Union**: `R ∪ S`

**Normalization Theory:**

* Functional dependencies: `X → Y`

**Query Complexity Analysis:**

* Sorting: `O(n log n)`
* Nested loop joins: `O(n ⋅ m)`
